### Live App Demo(in it's very early stages): https://taskflooow.netlify.app/

**Taskflow** is a web application that allows users to think and manage their workflows and projects online to improve their productivity.

The webapp is in it's very early stages as of now. Here's a list of proposed features that will be coming very soon!

2. Boards: Allows separation of ideas. Weather you want to store your favourite recipes or manage personal and work spaces separately. Boards are the way to do it.
3. Saving data inside tasks. You can add checklists in task and give descriptions in it.
